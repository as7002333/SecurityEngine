# üîê Security Engineer Projects

Welcome to my Security Engineering portfolio! This repository showcases hands-on projects demonstrating my expertise in securing applications, infrastructure, and DevSecOps workflows. Each project is designed to highlight real-world security challenges and solutions, focusing on areas such as:

‚úÖ GitHub Security Best Practices ‚Äì Implementing security controls for repositories, including branch protection, secret scanning, and dependency management.
‚úÖ CI/CD Pipeline Security ‚Äì Hardening GitHub Actions and integrating security tools to detect vulnerabilities in the software supply chain.
‚úÖ Cloud & Infrastructure Security ‚Äì Securing cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security practices.
‚úÖ Threat Detection & Response ‚Äì Building automation to monitor for security threats, enforce least privilege, and respond to incidents.
‚úÖ Application Security (AppSec) ‚Äì Identifying and mitigating common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) within web applications and APIs.

Each project includes documentation on its objectives, implementation steps, and security impact. Whether you're an aspiring security engineer, a hiring manager, or just passionate about cybersecurity, feel free to explore, contribute, and discuss!
